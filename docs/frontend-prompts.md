## Prompt 1: Chosing a frontend library

```
How can I use a design system instead of plain html to render my frontend and which design library would you recommend 
to use?
```

```
Why do we use emotion at all? And why do we suppressHydrationWarning? Is that neccessary? DO we still need the global.css
  when using chackra now? And why do we style our components manually so much? Can we just use the default chackra look?
```
